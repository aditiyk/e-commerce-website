A seperate html, css and javascript file has been created for from registration.

By adding "submit" event to our addEventListener, we targetted the form.
For the form validation, a separate function was created with three arguments such that whenever we submit a blank form, an error message is printed. 
It was also made sure that the icons are highlighted as well. 

Here is a video showing the live client-side form validation
