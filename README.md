If you click on "shop", it will land you to a featured-products page. Here all the products have been listed. 
If you click on "add to cart" button, you will see an increment in the number of items you have in your cart.



A seperate html, css and javascript file has been created for from registration.

By adding "submit" event to our addEventListener, we targetted the form.
For the form validation, a separate function was created with three arguments such that whenever we submit a blank form, an error message is printed. 
It was also made sure that the icons are highlighted as well. 

Here is a video showing the live client-side form validation
